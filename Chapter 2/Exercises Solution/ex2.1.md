## Ex 2.1. Differences between int, short, long, and long long 
The difference merely resides in size.

- **int**: 2 bytes
- **short**: 2 bytes
- **long**: 4 bytes
- **long long**:  8 bytes

However, int and short are the same size. So, the difference is preciseness. Using int guarantees that the number is at *least* as large as a short. 

## Differences between signed and unsigned type
The difference merely resides in sign.

- **signed**: accepts positive or negative numbers (including zero)
- **unsigned**: accepts numbers >= 0

## Differences between float and double
The difference merely resides in size.

- **float**: 4 bytes
- **double**: 8 bytes
