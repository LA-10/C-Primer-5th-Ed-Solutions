## 1. Writing a Simple C++ Program

- **Program Structure:**  
  Every C++ program contains one or more functions, with exactly one named `main`. This is the entry point of execution.  
```cpp
  int main() {
      return 0;
  }
```  
  - The `main` function must return an `int`.  
  - A `return 0;` signals successful execution to the operating system.  
  - Statements end with a semicolon `;`. Omitting semicolons leads to compiler errors.  

- **Types and Variables:**  
  A *type* defines the kind of data a variable holds and the operations allowed. For example, `int` is a built-in type representing integers. Variables must have a type before use.  

- **Compiling and Executing Programs:**  
  - Source files usually have suffixes like `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`.  
  - Compilers can be run via command-line or IDEs. Command-line compilation example (GNU compiler):  
```bash
    $ g++ -o prog1 prog1.cc
    $ ./prog1
```  
  - Executables on Windows have `.exe` suffix; Unix executables typically don't.  
  - Return values from `main` can be accessed via environment variables (`echo $?` on Unix, `%ERRORLEVEL%` on Windows).

## 2. A First Look at Input/Output (I/O)

- **Standard Library for I/O:**  
  C++ does not have built-in input/output statements. Instead, it uses the standard library, specifically the *iostream* library.  

- **Streams and Stream Objects:**  
  - `istream` for input (`std::cin`)  
  - `ostream` for output (`std::cout`)  
  - `std::cerr` for error messages (usually unbuffered)  
  - `std::clog` for logging (usually buffered)  

- **Output Example:**  
```cpp
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
```  
  - The `<<` operator outputs data to the stream.  
  - `std::endl` inserts a newline and flushes the output buffer, ensuring immediate display.  
  - Output operations can be chained due to the operator returning the stream.  

- **Input Example:**  
```cpp
  int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
  std::cin >> v1 >> v2;
```  
  - The `>>` operator reads data from the input stream into variables.  
  - Like output, input operations can be chained.  

- **Namespace `std`:**  
  Standard library names are in the `std` namespace, so `std::cout` and `std::endl` explicitly specify these names.  

- **Program Example (Sum of Two Numbers):**  
  Reads two integers and prints their sum.

## 3. A Word about Comments

- **Purpose:**  
  Comments clarify code for human readers without affecting program behavior.  

- **Types of Comments:**  
  - Single-line comments start with `//` and extend to the end of the line.  
  - Multi-line (block) comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They cannot be nested.  

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Keep comments accurate and update them when code changes.  
  - Use block comments for longer explanations and single-line comments for short notes.  
  - To comment out code blocks containing nested comments, use single-line comments on each line.

## 4. Flow of Control

- **Sequential Execution:**  
  Statements execute one after another by default.  

- **Loops:**  
  - **while loop:** Repeats a block while a condition is true.  
    Example: Sum numbers 1 to 10  
```cpp
    int sum = 0, val = 1;
    while (val <= 10) {
        sum += val;
        ++val;
    }
```  
  - **for loop:** A compact form for loops with initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.  
    Equivalent example:  
```cpp
    int sum = 0;
    for (int val = 1; val <= 10; ++val)
        sum += val;
```  

- **Reading Unknown Number of Inputs:**  
  Using `while (std::cin >> value)` to read until end-of-file or error.  

- **Conditional Execution (`if` statement):**  
  Executes statements based on a Boolean condition. Supports `if-else` branches.  

- **Example Program:**  
  Counting consecutive occurrences of input values.  

- **Common Operators:**  
  - `==` for equality testing  
  - `=` for assignment  
  - Be careful not to confuse the two.

## 5. Introducing Classes

- **What is a Class?**  
  Classes define new types that group data and operations together. They enable creation of user-defined types that behave like built-in types.  

- **The `Sales_item` Class:**  
  - Represents data related to book sales: ISBN, number of copies sold, total revenue, average price.  
  - Defined in a header file `Sales_item.h`.  
  - Provides operations such as:  
    - Fetching ISBN (`isbn()` member function)  
    - Input/output operators (`>>` and `<<`)  
    - Assignment (`=`)  
    - Addition (`+` and `+=`) of sales items with the same ISBN  

- **Using the Class:**  
  - Create variables of type `Sales_item`.  
  - Use `std::cin >>` and `std::cout <<` to read/write objects.  
  - Use `item1 + item2` to add two sales items.  

- **Member Functions:**  
  - Functions defined as part of a class, called on objects using the dot operator (`.`).  
  - Example: `item1.isbn()` returns the ISBN of `item1`.  

- **File Redirection:**  
  Operating systems allow redirecting input/output to/from files, facilitating testing without manual input.

## 6. The Bookstore Program

- **Problem:**  
  Read a file of book sales transactions and produce a report showing total copies sold, total revenue, and average price for each book (ISBN). Input is assumed to be grouped by ISBN.  

- **Approach:**  
  - Use two `Sales_item` variables:  
    - `total` for accumulating data for the current ISBN  
    - `trans` for the current transaction being read  
  - Read the first transaction into `total`  
  - For each subsequent transaction:  
    - If `trans` has the same ISBN as `total`, add it to `total`  
    - Else, output `total` and assign `trans` to `total`  
  - After processing all transactions, output the last `total`  

- **Error Handling:**  
  If no input is provided, print an error message and return a failure code (`-1`).  

- **Example program structure:**  
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  #include "Sales_item.h"

  int main() {
      Sales_item total;
      if (std::cin >> total) {
          Sales_item trans;
          while (std::cin >> trans) {
              if (total.isbn() == trans.isbn())
                  total += trans;
              else {
                  std::cout << total << std::endl;
                  total = trans;
              }
          }
          std::cout << total << std::endl;
      } else {
          std::cerr << "No data?!" << std::endl;
          return -1;
      }
      return 0;
  }
```

# Key Takeaways

- Understanding the structure of a C++ program and how to compile and run it is essential.  
- Input and output are handled via streams and operators, not built-in language constructs.  
- Flow control statements allow programs to make decisions and repeat operations.  
- Classes encapsulate data and behavior, enabling abstraction and modular design.  
- The bookstore program exemplifies combining these concepts to solve a real-world problem.
